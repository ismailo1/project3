Project 3 - Group 1

I am delighted to present Project 3, a comprehensive exploration tailored for employers, job seekers in the data realm, individuals contemplating joining a bootcamp, and esteemed global HR companies.

This endeavor addresses pertinent questions within the domain:

1.	What are the salary ranges across different countries (in USD)?
2.	Which job titles command the highest and lowest remunerations?
3.	Which job titles enjoy the highest popularity in each country, measured by counts?
4.	In which country does one find the most lucrative salary offerings?

Our sophisticated visuals provide profound insights:

1.	Immerse yourself in a Horizontal Bar Chart dynamically updating upon selecting a country, unveiling the top 10 highest-paying job titles in ascending order,
2.	Navigate through an interactive Map that evolves with country selection, offering a nuanced understanding of job title density and count globally,
3.	Explore a meticulously crafted Line Chart featuring two linesâ€”salary against job title with individual salary dots, and a second line delineating the correlation between experience level and salary.

This initiative serves as your compass for well-informed decisions in hiring, job seeking, bootcamp considerations, and global HR strategies.
